### untitled / Tile Engine

I have some ideas for where this is going but for now I'm just developing a somewhat generic overhead tile based engine.    
Currently, we have:
- infinite world generation (generator is a simple placeholder now, but data structures are in place)
- chunking system and renderer
- wall tiles can cast shadows, the renderer for this is built
- 2 stage downsample renderer can pixellate to the same scale as the pixel art
- developing action / event / engine side at the moment
- main branch is a demo in which you can walk around, place shadow casting blocks, look around
